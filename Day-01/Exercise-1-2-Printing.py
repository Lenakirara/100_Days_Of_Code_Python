Exercicio 01 - Python Print Function:
Write a program that prints the same notes as the previous lesson using what you learned about Python's print function.

Exercicio 02 - String Manipulation:
Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors:

print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

"""

# Exercise 01
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print('What to print')

# Exercise 02
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

*** Other way (exer - 01) ***
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function\nThe function is declared like this:\nprint('what to print')")
